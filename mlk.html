                <h5><span>THE MAN</span></h5>
                <p id="tribute-info">Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929 to his father, the Sr., and his
                    mother Alberta. Both of his parents were college-educated, with his father serving as the pastor of
                    a prestigious Atlanta church. King was the second of three children, with an older sister Christine
                    and a younger brother Alfred Daniel (A.D.) </p>
                <p>Originally born Michael Luther King Jr., King was five years old when his father changed both his own
                    name, as well as his son’s, from “Michael Luther” to “Martin Luther”. His father made the change
                    after travelling in Europe, where he was inspired by the legacy of the Reformation leader Martin
                    Luther.</p>
                <p>King experienced bigotry and prejudice from a young age, once remarking that at age six he was not
                    able to play with a friend of his any longer because his friend’s parents would not allow their
                    white son to play with a black child.</p>
                <p>At fifteen years old he was admitted to Morehouse College, where he spent three years before
                    beginning his bachelor of divinity at Crozer Theological Seminary, graduating in 1951 at the age of
                    22. He would eventually go on to serve as co-pastor at the Ebeneezer Baptist Church in Atlanta,
                    alongside his father, from 1960 up until his death.
                <p>
                <p>From Crozer he went on to Boston University, where he met his wife Coretta Scott as the result of a
                    blind date, marrying her in 1953. Together they would have four children: Yolanda, Martin Luther
                    III, Dexter Scott, and Bernice.</p>
                <p>He and his wife were approaching their 15-year wedding anniversary when Dr. King was assassinated on
                    April 4, 1968.</p>

            <div class="column2">
                <h6><span>THE LEADER</span></h6>
                <p id="tribute-info-2">King’s first significant leadership role came as the head of the Montgomery
                    Improvement Association, leading a boycott of the transit system in response to the actions of Rosa
                    Parks in 1955. Shortly afterwards, King was elected president of the Southern Christian Leadership
                    Conference, an organization formed to provide new leadership for the burgeoning civil rights
                    movement.</p>
                <p>In the eleven-year period between 1957 and 1968, King traveled over six million miles and spoke over
                    twenty-five hundred times, appearing wherever there was injustice, protest, and action. His public
                    image put his safety at risk on multiple fronts, with the first attempt on his life taking place in
                    1958 when he was stabbed in the chest by a woman with severe mental illness.</p>
                <p>King delivered one of the most famous speeches in history – the “I Have a Dream” speech – as one of
                    the leaders of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963.</p>
                <p>King’s company was sought out by sitting Presidents and world leaders during a time when he was
                    arrested on over two dozen occasions and assaulted by officials on at least four occasions. He was
                    awarded five honorary degrees, was named Man of the Year by Time magazine in 1963, and became not
                    only the symbolic leader of American blacks but also a world figure. At the age of thirty-five, King
                    was the youngest man to ever be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
                <p>In 1983, President Reagan signed Martin Luther King Jr. Day into law as a federal holiday. King is
                    only the second American to have a federal holiday named in his honor, the other being George
                    Washington.</p>
